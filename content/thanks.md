It’s great to have you on board!

The Practical Hugo course is still in early development, but you’ll be the first to know as soon as it launches.

 As a way of saying thank you for your early support, you’ll also get **free access to all the course material**.

In return, all I ask is for a few moments of your time. 

Please complete [a short survey about your experience with Hugo](https://harrycresswell.typeform.com/to/drSopGck). Your answers will help me tailor content to make the course as useful as possible.

Thanks again for subscribing!

Harry
