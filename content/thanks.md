It’s great to have you on board!

Practical Hugo is currently in development, but you’ll be the first to know as soon as it launches.

As a way of saying thank you for your early support, I’d like to offer you **free access to all the course material**,  

In return, all I ask is for you to complete [a short survey about your experience with Hugo](https://harrycresswell.typeform.com/to/drSopGck).

The answers you provide will help me to make this course as useful to you as possible.

Thanks again for subscribing!

Harry
