### New feature

- Added  a skip link to improve accessibility, so you can now jump straight to main content using keyboard tabbing, etc
- Improved link legibility by adding a hover effect
### Bug fixes & improvements

- Added `text-size-adjust` to reset to prevent inflated text on mobile landscape orientation. [Props to Kilian](https://kilianvalkhof.com/2022/css-html/your-css-reset-needs-text-size-adjust-probably/) for help with this one
- Updated changelog permalink structure to include year, month and day
