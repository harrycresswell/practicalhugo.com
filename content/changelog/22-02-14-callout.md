A couple of small adjustments to the callout and the curriculum section.

### Bug fixes & improvements

- Callout now uses dotted outline rather than a background colour, so it doesn’t clash with the sign up form. This was more of an issue for the single column layout, as seen on smaller displays
- Dropped the word “The” from “The Curriculum”, feels cleaner
