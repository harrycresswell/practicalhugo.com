Homepage now includes a course curriculum, well part of one at least. More to come soon. Lot’s of other smaller bits too.

### New features

- Currculum added to homepage
- Scroll margin added to id’s for elements that can be targeted, [a nice little trick](https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/add-scroll-margin-to-all-elements-which-can-be-targeted) I leart from Andy Bell
- Menu added to sitehead

### Changes

- Site logo in sitehead moved to left and site title hidden for all but screen readers
- Sign up form now sticky on larger devices

### Bug fixes & improvements

- Callout now takes an optional icon, also added missing box shadow
- Replaced missing paragraph spacing on generic single pages, like [thanks](/thanks), etc.
